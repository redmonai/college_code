/*
 * Tic-tac-toe Game
 * Tic-tac-toe, also called noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a game of two players, X and O, who take turns marking the 
 * spaces in a 3 Ã— 3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal 
 * row wins the game [see Figure 1].
 * 
 * Write a Java program which will allow to two users to play a game of Tic-tac-toe against each other.  [If  you get this 
 * done consider extending your program to allow a user to play a game of Tic-tac-toe against an intelligent computer player.]
